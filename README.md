Tournament Management Server Source

## Event metadata

Start the server with `node group-server.js` and open `http://localhost:3000/`, which
loads Tournament Setup (`/tournament-setup/`), the pre-tournament hub page.
Use the separate pages for each step:
- Event Definition: `/tournament-setup/event-definition/`
- Import Registration: `/tournament-setup/import/`
- Build Groups: `/tournament-setup/build-groups/`
- Review & Save: `/tournament-setup/review-save/`
Event details are managed at `/tournament-setup/event-definition/`.
Restart the server after backend changes; refreshing the page alone does not reload server code.

## Multi-Surface Tournament Backend

This branch is being used to document a proposed split of tournament surfaces by
port and operational purpose:

- `3000` Pre-Tournament
- `3001-3009` Day-of Event surfaces
  - `3001` Ring Assignment Operations
  - `3002` Event Progress / display-only
  - `3003` Medical
  - `3004` Administration Progress View
  - `3005-3009` Reserved for additional Day-of surfaces
- `3010+` Post-Tournament

The goal is to keep the surfaces loosely coupled while sharing the same server
backend and data model.

The active surface can be selected with the `TOURNAMENT_SURFACE` environment
variable. If unset, the server defaults to `pre`.
Use `monitoring` for the public Event Progress view and `adminProgress` for the
Administration Progress View.
Exact entry points:
- `http://localhost:3002/event-progress/` for the public Event Progress view
- `http://localhost:3004/administration-progress/` for the Administration Progress view
Launcher: [launch-surfaces.ps1](./launch-surfaces.ps1)

Ring layout dimensions are saved in each event's `event-config.json` as numeric
`ringConfigX` (Ring Config Columns, shown as letters) and `ringConfigY` (Ring Config
Rows, shown as numbers) fields (non-negative whole numbers; blank inputs
default to zero). Creating or modifying an event saves both dimensions. Older
`ringConfig` strings such as `"2 x 3"` are read for compatibility and converted to
numeric fields on the next save.

## Group storage cleanup

The server now treats the database and in-memory store as the active source of
truth for groups/divisions. Legacy filesystem group folders are no longer part
of the event lifecycle.

### What changed
- Root `groups/` folder lifecycle handling was removed
- Per-event `groups/` folder creation and deletion was removed
- Group lookup, `/api/groups`, division build/save, and ring flow still work
  through the live in-memory store populated from the database

### Practical effect
This reduces stale filesystem state while preserving the current runtime
behavior for divisions and ring assignment flows.
